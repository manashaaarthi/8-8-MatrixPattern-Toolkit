            <h2>96 Thathuvams (Elements of Siddha)</h2>
            <p>The **96 Thathuvams** form the philosophical and practical foundation of Siddha. They represent the various components that constitute the human body and mind, encompassing cosmological, physiological, and psychological elements. Understanding the balance and imbalance of these 96 principles is key to Siddha diagnosis and treatment.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Thathuvams include categories like the **Ahamkaram** (Ego), **Gnanendriyas** (Sense Organs), and more.</li>

            <h2>Panchabootham (The Five Elements)</h2>
            <p>Siddha, like many ancient systems, is rooted in the concept of the **Panchabootham**, or the five primordial elements. Every substance in the universe, including the human body, is composed of a combination of these elements. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>**Prithvi** (Earth): Represents solidity and structure.</li>
                <li>**Appu** (Water): Represents fluidity and cohesion.</li>
                <li>**Theyu** (Fire): Represents energy, transformation, and heat.</li>
                <li>**Vayu** (Air): Represents movement and gaseous form.</li>
                <li>**Akash** (Ether/Space): Represents the space they occupy.</li>

            <h2>The Importance of Herbs in Siddha Healing</h2>
            <p>Herbal medicine is a cornerstone of Siddha treatment. Practitioners utilize a vast knowledge base of indigenous flora to create formulations. The selection of a herb is often based on its **taste (Suvai)** and **potency (Veeryam)**, which determine its energetic action on the body's humor (tridosha) system.</p>
            <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Siddha medicine also incorporates minerals, metals, and animal products, though herbal treatments are the most common.</p>

            <h2>Timeline of Siddha Medicine (Ancient → Modern)</h2>
            <p>Siddha is one of the oldest medicinal systems known to humanity, believed to have originated in ancient South India.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Ancient Era (2000 BCE - 500 CE):** Attributed to the **Siddhars** (enlightened beings), who codified the treatments and philosophy.</li>
                <li>**Medieval Era:** The knowledge was preserved and expanded through palm-leaf manuscripts.</li>
                <li>**Modern Era:** Siddha is now recognized by the Government of India and integrated into various healthcare and educational institutions.</li>
